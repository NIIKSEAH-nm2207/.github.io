                    Singapore. This will be especially helpful for cafehoppers as they are able to spot cafe clusters
                    that
                    will entice them.

                    especially youths.

                    saturated
                    with cafes.
                    <br>Relevant details: The markers on the map will showcase the cafe locations very clearly.
                    <br>Design elements: The website will be minimalistic and black and white. This will allow it to be
                    color-blind friendly, fuss-free, and easy to navigate.
